	of 1993, partially as an outgrowth of the Unofficial
	386BSDPatchkit by the patchkit's last 3 coordinators: Nate
	Williams, Rod Grimes and Jordan Hubbard.</p><a id="idp56512800" class="indexterm"></a><p>The original goal was to produce an intermediate snapshot
	of 386BSD in order to fix a number of problems with it that
	the patchkit mechanism just was not capable of solving.  The
	early working title for the project was 386BSD 0.5 or 386BSD
	Interim in reference of that fact.</p><a id="idp56519584" class="indexterm"></a><p>386BSD was Bill Jolitz's operating system, which had been
	up to that point suffering rather severely from almost a
	year's worth of neglect.  As the patchkit swelled ever more
	uncomfortably with each passing day, they decided to assist
	Bill by providing this interim <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">cleanup</span>&#8221;</span>
	snapshot.  Those plans came to a rude halt when Bill Jolitz
	suddenly decided to withdraw his sanction from the project
	without any clear indication of what would be done
	instead.</p><a id="idp56522912" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp56523680" class="indexterm"></a><p>The trio thought that the goal remained worthwhile, even
	without Bill's support, and so they adopted the name "FreeBSD"
	coined by David Greenman.  The initial objectives were set
	after consulting with the system's current users and, once it
	became clear that the project was on the road to perhaps even
	becoming a reality, Jordan contacted Walnut Creek CDROM with
	an eye toward improving FreeBSD's distribution channels for those
	many unfortunates without easy access to the Internet.  Walnut
	Creek CDROM not only supported the idea of distributing FreeBSD
	on CD but also went so far as to provide the project with a
	machine to work on and a fast Internet connection.  Without
	Walnut Creek CDROM's almost unprecedented degree of faith in
	what was, at the time, a completely unknown project, it is
	quite unlikely that FreeBSD would have gotten as far, as fast, as
	it has today.</p><a id="idp56530080" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp56531232" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp56532640" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp56533792" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp56535072" class="indexterm"></a><p>The first CD-ROM (and general net-wide) distribution was
	FreeBSD 1.0, released in December of 1993.  This was based
	on the 4.3BSD-Lite (<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Net/2</span>&#8221;</span>) tape from U.C.
	Berkeley, with many components also provided by 386BSD and the
	Free Software Foundation.  It was a fairly reasonable success
	for a first offering, and they followed it with the highly
	successful FreeBSD 1.1 release in May of 1994.</p><a id="idp56537888" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp56539552" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp56541088" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp56542240" class="indexterm"></a><p>Around this time, some rather unexpected storm clouds
	formed on the horizon as Novell and U.C. Berkeley settled
	their long-running lawsuit over the legal status of the
	Berkeley Net/2 tape.  A condition of that settlement was U.C.
	Berkeley's concession that large parts of Net/2 were
	<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">encumbered</span>&#8221;</span> code and the property of Novell, who
	had in turn acquired it from AT&amp;T some time previously.
	What Berkeley got in return was Novell's
	<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">blessing</span>&#8221;</span> that the 4.4BSD-Lite release, when
	it was finally released, would be declared unencumbered and
	all existing Net/2 users would be strongly encouraged to
	switch.  This included FreeBSD, and the project was given until
	the end of July 1994 to stop shipping its own Net/2 based
	product.  Under the terms of that agreement, the project was
	allowed one last release before the deadline, that release
	being FreeBSD 1.1.5.1.</p><p>FreeBSD then set about the arduous task of literally
	re-inventing itself from a completely new and rather
	incomplete set of 4.4BSD-Lite bits.  The <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Lite</span>&#8221;</span>
	releases were light in part because Berkeley's CSRG had
	removed large chunks of code required for actually
	constructing a bootable running system (due to various legal
	requirements) and the fact that the Intel port of 4.4 was
	highly incomplete.  It took the project until November of 1994
	to make this transition, and in December it released
	FreeBSD 2.0 to the world.  Despite being still more than a
	little rough around the edges, the release was a significant
	success and was followed by the more robust and easier to
	install FreeBSD 2.0.5 release in June of 1995.</p><p>Since that time, FreeBSD has made a series of releases each
	time improving the stability, speed, and feature set of the
	previous version.</p><p>For now, long-term development projects continue to take
	place in the 10.X-CURRENT (trunk) branch, and snapshot
	releases of 10.X are continually made available from <a class="link" href="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/snapshots/" target="_top">the
	  snapshot server</a> as work progresses.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="goals"></a>1.3.2. FreeBSD Project Goals</h3></div><div><span class="authorgroup">Contributed by <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author"><span class="firstname">Jordan</span> <span class="surname">Hubbard</span></span>. </span></div></div></div><a id="idp56568736" class="indexterm"></a><p>The goals of the FreeBSD Project are to provide software
	that may be used for any purpose and without strings attached.
	Many of us have a significant investment in the code (and
	project) and would certainly not mind a little financial
	compensation now and then, but we are definitely not prepared
	to insist on it.  We believe that our first and foremost
	<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">mission</span>&#8221;</span> is to provide code to any and all
	comers, and for whatever purpose, so that the code gets the
	widest possible use and provides the widest possible benefit.
	This is, I believe, one of the most fundamental goals of Free
	Software and one that we enthusiastically support.</p><a id="idp56572576" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp56574112" class="indexterm"></a><a id="idp56575904" class="indexterm"></a><p>That code in our source tree which falls under the GNU
	General Public License (GPL) or Library General Public License
	(LGPL) comes with slightly more strings attached, though at
	least on the side of enforced access rather than the usual
	opposite.  Due to the additional complexities that can evolve
	in the commercial use of GPL software we do, however, prefer
	software submitted under the more relaxed BSD copyright when
	it is a reasonable option to do so.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div xmlns="" class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="title"><a id="development"></a>1.3.3. The FreeBSD Development Model</h3></div><div><span class="authorgroup">Contributed by <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="author"><span class="firstname">Satoshi</span> <span class="surname">Asami</span></span>. </span></div></div></div><a id="idp56590880" class="indexterm"></a><p>The development of FreeBSD is a very open and flexible

	      For several years, the central source tree for FreeBSD
	      was maintained by
	      <a class="link" href="http://www.nongnu.org/cvs/" target="_top">CVS</a>
	      (Concurrent Versions System), a freely available source
	      code control tool.  In June 2008, the Project switched
	      to using <a class="link" href="http://subversion.tigris.org" target="_top">SVN</a>
	      (Subversion).  The switch was deemed necessary, as the
	      technical limitations imposed by
	      <span class="application">CVS</span> were becoming obvious due
	      to the rapid expansion of the source tree and the amount
	      of history already stored.  The Documentation Project
	      and Ports Collection repositories also moved from
	      <span class="application">CVS</span> to

	ported software collection with thousands of commonly
	sought-after programs.  At the time of this writing, there
	were over 24,000 ports!  The list of ports ranges from
	http servers, to games, languages, editors, and almost
	everything in between.  The entire Ports Collection requires
	approximately 500 MB.  To compile a port, you simply
	change to the directory of the program you wish to install,
	type <code class="command">make install</code>, and let the system do
	the rest.  The full original distribution for each port you
	build is retrieved dynamically so you need only enough disk
	space to build the ports you want.  Almost every port is also
	provided as a pre-compiled <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">package</span>&#8221;</span>, which can
	be installed with a simple command
	(<code class="command">pkg install</code>) by those who do not wish to
	compile their own ports from source.  More information on
